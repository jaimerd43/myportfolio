								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/_DSC0058.jpg" alt="" class="small-vertical-image"/></span>My name is Jaime Rubio, I have a strong academic background in <b>Air Transport Operations and Management from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid</b>, complemented by a deep passion for business, programming and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
								<p>During my academic journey, I participated as a research assistant in an aviation project that involved the analysis of air traffic controller simulator data. I am currently pursuing a <b>master’s in Business Analytics at Queen’s University Belfast</b> to further develop my programming skills. This educational adventure aligns with my commitment to continuous learning and my ongoing desire to get out of my comfort zone. I am expanding my proficiency in <b>SQL, Python, Tableau and R</b> while delving into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence. </p>
								<p>My enthusiasm for programming was further demonstrated in my undergraduate dissertation. I extended with Python the software developed during my research project, incorporating additional variables to correlate physical factors, such as brain activity, with air traffic controller performance. This project gave me the opportunity to present it to CRIDA, a company that was interested in my software.</p>
								<p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I have actively improved my <b>communication, leadership, and management skills through my part-time role at a science academy. For the past three years, I have taught mathematics, physics, and chemistry</b> to students preparing for </b>university</b> entrance exams. Managing groups of 10 people, this role provided me with valuable experience.</p>

							<h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>
								<div class="box">
									<p>Business has always been an essential part of my life, and I have always been an active reader on the subject. My journey into the business world began when I was a senior in high school. My classmates needed custom hoodies, and I saw an opportunity to turn this into a profitable business. I quickly searched for suppliers and started offering custom sweatshirts to my classmates. This inspired me to create a business called "Textil Impresiones" operating in the madrid community. I used social media to promote my business and distributed flyers in schools to reach a wider audience. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I adapted my business model to find alternative clients, providing customized clothing and websites for emergency artists and podcasters. This experience taught me how to deal with suppliers, as I became a client of FALK AND ROSS, one of Spain's largest textile manufacturing companies. In addition, I learned how to find customers and how to interact with them.</p>
						
									<div class="row">
										
											<ul>
												<li><b>Business skills</b>: I developed essential business skills such as identifying opportunities, sourcing suppliers and adapting to changing market conditions.</li>
												<li><b>Customer relationship management</b>: I learned how to establish and maintain customer relationships, which is crucial to the success of any business.</li>
												<li><b>Supply chain management</b>: Dealing with suppliers and supply chain management gave me a better understanding of the logistics process.</li>
												
											</ul>
									<p>Unfortunately I don't have pictures of all the works or I can only find videos, but here below it can be seen from left to right: Flyers that were distributed at the school exits, capture of the landing page of one of the artists that I made the website and t-shirts for, and one of the more than 20 models of t-shirts that were made for a radio program called "Cutre y Medio Mal".</p>

							<h2>Books</h2>
								<div class="box">
									<p>I am an active reader of numerous subjects among which I highlight: business, philosophy and psychology.
										Books are not only a delightful escape, but also a profound path to knowledge, an essential nourishment for the human mind.
										I invite everyone to explore the books that have captivated my attention through my Goodreads profile. Connect with me on that platform so we can share our reading adventures!

							<h2>Podcast</h2>
								<div class="box">
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Captura de pantalla 2024-01-20 a las 18.10.31.png" alt="" class="small-vertical-image"/></span>Several months ago, my friend Javier Soltero and I started an exciting podcast project called "La mesa del desacuerdo". Our inspiration for this adventure came from our unique geographical locations: while I study in Belfast (UK), Javier resides in Perth (Australia). We believe this diversity adds distinctive value to our podcast, encouraging others to explore different territories.

										This venture fills me with enthusiasm, not only because of the project itself, but also because it gives me an excellent opportunity to improve my communication skills. In an increasingly automated world, effective communication will be crucial, and this podcast allows me to develop this essential skill.
										
										Our podcast is in Spanish and can be found on Spotify under the name, "La mesa del desacuerdo". We are committed to continually improving its quality and look forward to delivering engaging and valuable content to our audience.</p>
